The files in this package are organized as it follows:

- **gml**: ZooTopology GML's inside.
- **synthethic_**: All the folders starting with `synthethic_` contain data related to synthethic networks, such as json, xml, q, ltl and tapaal files.
- **zoo_**: All the folders starting with `zoo_` contain data relevant to the topology zoo networks.
- **time**: This folder contains all the overhead time data, more specifically the time required by python to prepare, build a JSON file, build an XML, Q and TAPN file, or build a LTL file.

> All the files on this branch are generated with trivial switches where the initial and final routing configuration allows it.
